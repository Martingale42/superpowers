# Orchestrator-Driven Development

## Overview

Generate a complete set of session files that power a multi-agent orchestration pipeline. The orchestrator runs in a parallel session, dispatching executor/reviewer/QA as subagents in a deterministic cycle with review gates.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the orchestrator-driven-development skill to generate session files."

## When This Runs

This skill is invoked when the user picks option 3 (Orchestrator) from the writing-plans execution handoff. By this point, a plan already exists at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Project Context

Read and extract from the codebase:

1. **Plan file** — task list, phases, verification commands, commit conventions
2. **Design doc** — if referenced in the plan header
3. **Project-specific rules** — linting, formatting, coding conventions (e.g., `no unwrap()` for Rust, `bun run build` for frontend)
4. **Verification commands** — build, test, lint, format commands from the plan or codebase
5. **Project name** — from the plan header or directory name

### Step 2: Define Batch Order

Group plan tasks into batches following these rules:

- **Group by phase** — each phase in the plan becomes a batch
- **Batch table** — number, phase name, task range, short description
- **Ordering** — follow the plan's phase order (which may differ from task number order)
- If the plan has no phases, group into batches of 3-5 related tasks

### Step 2.5: Assign Models & Effort to Roles

Before generating files, collect a model + effort for each role and a Final Audit depth
with the **AskUserQuestion tool**. That tool caps at **4 questions, each with at most
4 options**, so use exactly this shape:

- **4 questions** (at the cap): one per role (Executor, Reviewer, QA), each offering
  curated `model · effort` combos, plus one for **Final Audit depth**.
- Each question lists **up to 4 curated options**, the **default first** with
  `(Recommended)` appended to its label. The tool auto-adds an **Other** choice — that is
  where the user types a custom `model · effort` not listed.
- Do **not** ask one question per (role × dimension): 3 roles × 2 dimensions = 6 questions
  exceeds the cap, and packing every `model × effort` combo into one question (3 × 4 = 12)
  exceeds the 4-option cap.

Curated option sets (Option 1 = the default; apply it if the user skips that question):

| Role | Option 1 (Recommended) | Option 2 | Option 3 | Option 4 |
|------|------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Executor | `sonnet` · high | `sonnet` · xhigh | `opus` · high | `haiku` · medium |
| Reviewer | `opus` · xhigh | `opus` · high | `sonnet` · xhigh | `sonnet` · high |
| QA | `sonnet` · high | `sonnet` · xhigh | `opus` · high | `haiku` · medium |
| Final Audit | `/code-review` at high | `/code-review` at max | skip | — |

Rules:
- **Model** is restricted to `{opus, sonnet, haiku}` — family-level, always the latest
  version in that family (no version pinning).
- **Effort** is one of `low / medium / high / xhigh / max` — **also a hard setting**:
  both model and effort are written into the generated
  `.claude/agents/orchestrator-<role>.md` frontmatter, which the harness enforces for
  every dispatch of that subagent type.
- `ultracode` is a Claude Code **session-only setting** (xhigh + dynamic workflows), not
  an effort level: it cannot be assigned to roles and is not recommended for the
  orchestrator session itself (the coordinator should not spawn its own workflows).
- `ultrathink` is a user-facing one-shot prompt toggle; the pipeline does **not** use it
  (frontmatter effort replaced keyword prepending; `think`/`think hard` are no-ops in
  current Claude Code).
- **Executor-for-fixes** reuses the Executor assignment; **Reviewer-for-verify** reuses
  the Reviewer assignment; Final Audit fix dispatches reuse the Executor assignment.
- If the user skips a question, apply the defaults — never block generation.
- The orchestrator session's own model and effort cannot be set here (it is the session
  the user opens manually); `orchestrator.md` records a recommendation instead
  (`opus`, `/effort high`).

Carry the resulting `(model, effort)` for each role plus the Final Audit choice into
Step 3 as the substitution values for the `{{EXECUTOR_MODEL}}` / `{{EXECUTOR_EFFORT}}`,
`{{REVIEWER_*}}`, `{{QA_*}}`, and `{{AUDIT_DEPTH}}` placeholders.

### Step 3: Generate Session Files

Create all files in `<project-root>/docs/sessions/`:

| File | Template | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `orchestrator.md` | `orchestrator-template.md` | Main orchestrator prompt — pipeline flow, dispatch templates, orchestration loop, progress tracking |
| `resume.md` | `resume-template.md` | Recovery prompt — reads progress.json, points to orchestrator.md for full rules |
| `01-executor.md` | `executor-template.md` | Standalone executor for ad-hoc use |
| `02-code-reviewer.md` | `reviewer-template.md` | Standalone reviewer for ad-hoc use |
| `03-qa-tester.md` | `qa-template.md` | Standalone QA tester for ad-hoc use |
| `progress.json` | `progress-template.json` | Initial state: batch 1, step execute |

**When generating each file:**
- Read the corresponding template for structure and format
- Fill in project-specific content: project name, plan paths, batch order, rules, verification commands
- Adapt dispatch prompts to the project's language/framework (Rust → cargo, JS → npm/bun, Python → pytest, etc.)
- Substitute the per-role model, effort, and thinking-keyword placeholders from the Step 2.5 assignments

### Step 4: Commit and Hand Off

1. Commit all session files: `git add docs/sessions/ && git commit -m "docs: add orchestrator session files"`
2. Tell the user:

```
Session files generated in docs/sessions/.

To start the orchestrator:
1. Open a new Claude Code session in this project directory
2. Paste the content of docs/sessions/orchestrator.md as the initial prompt

If the orchestrator session gets interrupted:
1. Open a new session
2. Paste the content of docs/sessions/resume.md as the initial prompt
```

## Pipeline Architecture (for reference)

The generated orchestrator follows this cycle:

```
Per Batch:
  Executor (implement) → Reviewer (review)
    → if CHANGES_REQUESTED: Executor (fix) → Reviewer (verify) → loop (max 3)
    → if still CHANGES_REQUESTED after 3: STOP, ask user
    → if APPROVED: next batch

After All Batches:
  QA (full test) → if FAIL: Executor (fix) → QA (verify) → loop (max 2)
    → if still FAIL after 2: STOP, ask user
    → if PASS: done
```

## Key Principles

- **Templates are structural guides, not literal substitution** — read the template for format, fill in project-specific content based on what you gathered in Step 1
- **Language-agnostic** — adapt verification commands and coding rules to the project's stack
- **Self-healing via progress.json** — the orchestrator can resume from any interruption
- **Standalone role files are backup** — the orchestrator dispatches roles as subagents, but the standalone files let users run roles independently
- **resume.md points to orchestrator.md** — keeps one source of truth for the pipeline rules
